This project began in 2005 and has grown substantially. Currently the project is in the third phase. This phase serves Neal Goodloe as a client representing community data owners and operates on a sensitive dataset. The goal of the project is to analyze community data across silos and present findings to the data owners that they are unable to obtain on their own~\cite{ref:uva}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item This project has received funding awards totaling \$547,580 from State and Local Agencies
\item As a result of this analysis the City has established a Behavioral Health Docket (8 graduates so far) \cite{ref:docket}
\item Fifty undergraduates have worked on this project as their capstone~\cite{ref:sieds}
\item Established a secured sensitive data set from local data owners
\end{enumerate}

This project began as a capstone project in the systems engineering department. Currently the Thomas Jefferson Area Coalition for the Homeless with help from the Urban Institute are looking to launch a DSI capstone project in this space.

The data owners include: Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ), Central Virginia Regional Jail (CVRJ), Region 10 (R10), Thomas Jefferson Area Coalition for the Homeless (TJACH), Virginia Department of Corrections (VADOC), Offender Aid and Restoration (OAR).

Funding agencies include the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS), County of Albemarle, City of Charlottesville, and the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.
