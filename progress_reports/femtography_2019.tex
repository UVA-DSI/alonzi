The 2018-2019 year was the start of the Femtography effort at UVA~\cite{ref:siwif}. This project encompasses a national research effort culminating in the creation of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC: a 1.5\,B\$ research facility~\cite{ref:eic}). The initial funding for the effort at UVA came from the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia~\cite{ref:cnf}. The laboratory support for this project comes from Jefferson Lab~\cite{ref:jlab}. Major achievements this year include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Hosting an international symposium by UVA at the Boar's Head~\cite{ref:symp}
\item Award of \$50,835 for a summer institute (SIWIF) from the Governor's Office
\item Membership on the Jefferson Lab Center for Nuclear Femtography Steering Committee (CNF)
\end{enumerate}

Locally a collaboration between the Data Science Institute and the College of Arts and Sciences has been formed. The SIWIF award was a joint venture with Professor Liuti from CLAS acting as the PI and Dr. Alonzi from the DSI as a CO-PI.

The Governor's office has commissioned Jefferson Lab to establish a Center for Nuclear Femtography (CNF). Due to leading the symposium in the fall at UVA and the award of the summer institute money UVA has taken a leading role in this effort.
